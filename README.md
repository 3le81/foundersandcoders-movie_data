# MOVIE DATA

Project for Founders and Coders :

> "For this project, we’d like you to build a user interface, using HTML, and populate that with data from a JavaScript object. We’ve given you a data object below.
> Make this project your own, what you build as an interface and how you choose to display the data is up to you.
> We’d like you to include ways for the user to interact with the data. For example, you might allow the user to sort the movies by the year they were released, or add a new movie to the movieData object."
